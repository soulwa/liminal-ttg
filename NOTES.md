meta objective:
- identify items which can be used to defeat the monster
- reveal the monster
- fight the monster
- unlock the boss and beat them too
- boom you win

need to consider:
- not being revealed by teacher (map influences this a lot)
- protecting teachers (scrying monster maybe? to control behavior?)

stuff to have for session:
items -- how will they enhance gameplay? what incentivizes searching? is searching 1 and done for a tile, or per tile per player?
auras -- what are some fun things we can do?

teacher behaviors:
easy (repetition)

1. dont rotate
2. 1 tile in forward direction, snaking around hallway
3. reverse direction

harder (more localized)

1. 1 tile in forward direction
2. pick adjacent room (in hallway, classroom, in classroom, another room, 50-50)
3. move into the hallway

monster behaviors
if player in line of sight, lunge forward to player (stuns player for 1 turn)
if lands on player tile, stuns player for 1 turn
if lands on teacher tile, brings teacher into other realm
defeated by being surrounded by players on 3/4 sides, using items (for now...)

1. move forward 2 tiles (towards entrance)
2. move to an adjacent (diagonal too) classroom
3. flip to the realm not currently in

base game

- capstone: polishing the "vertical slice" of their game
   - visual artists, composers, sound designers
   - "what do you want game to look like?" : how do you give enough to work with how game should look?
