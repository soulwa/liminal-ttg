# LIMINAL - a tabletop game about magic, space, and magical spaces

# RULES

## BOARD SETUP:

Arrange the play tiles for the game in the following manner:


|          | Classroom | Detention | Bathroom  | Classroom |           |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Entryway | Hallway 1 | Hallway 2 | Hallway 3 | Hallway 4 | Stairwell |
|          | Classroom | Special   | Classroom | Closet    |           |

Note that the Detention space is also a classroom.

## Objective:

You are a group of best friends at **FOREST GROVE HIGH SCHOOL**. Unbeknownst to the rest of the school, you are a group of witches! 
Your powers are derived from a magical incident from when the (3/4) of you were younger. Now, the same forces that gave you your
magic then have found a new way to enter your world... through the walls of your high school! Your friend group serves as the last line
of defense between your dimension and the Other Realm. Unfortunately, you'll have to save everyone during a school day, and the negative
emotional aura exuding from the Other Realm has put all the teachers on edge. Can you put an end to the spirits invading your high school,
while also keeping the existence of the Other Realm secret?

## Items:
- 1 D3
- 1 D4
- 2 D6
- 5 classroom aura cards
- 4 item cards
- 4 classroom item cards

## CHARACTER SETUP:

Players are assigned a witch character. <!-- , who has a special power. Read the trait which your character has, and perform any pre-game actions which that
trait may describe. -->

Place 3 teachers on the first floor, 4 teachers on the second floor, and 1 teacher, as well as the principal, on the final floor. Roll 2 six-sided die for the
first two floors to determine teacher placement. Roll 1 six-sided die to determine placement on the final floor. The principal always begins in the office.

All players begin in the **ENTRYWAY**. <!-- If any of the starting witches are **MISCHEVIOUS**, they may choose to start in the detention room instead. -->

<!-- Each player may draw an item (** from a specific pile?) to begin with. -->

## END STATES:
The players lose the game if any of the following happen:

1. Any member of the group is **IDENTIFIED** by enough teachers.
2. Too many teachers are **TAKEN** to the Other Realm at once.
<!-- 3. The spirits grow **RESTLESS**; the school becomes invaded. -->

## GAMEPLAY:
Turns alternate between the **WITCH TURN** (players can move) and the **OTHER TURN** (teachers and monsters move). On the *WITCH TURN*, 
players can perform any number of the following actions once:

1. **MOVE** -- players can move up to the amount of tiles designated by their *SPEED*. 
   - players can move into a tile with a teacher, but not out of a tile with a teacher unless they perform a *detention roll*.
   - players can advance up and down stairwells at no cost (note: in this version of the game, there is only 1 floor)
   - only ending your move on a tile will trigger the effects of that tile, at the time you finish moving.

2. **SCRY** -- players may SCRY once per turn. Scrying reveals information about different things in the school.
   1. *scrying* on a tile will reveal that tile's *aura*. This hints at what item might appear when you *summon* on the tile.
      - every time you scry on a tile, draw an aura card. the card will note whether the tile contains nothing, an item, or if the tile is the *liminal space* for the game.
      - if the *liminal space* is revealed, flip the tile which it corresponds to.
   2. Players may *scry* on a tile with a teacher to "reveal" that teacher's mood. Choose one action this teacher takes when they move, rather than rolling a dice. This wears off
    after leaving the floor.
   3. *scrying* can stack; multiple things in the game can be effected by scrying at once if the preconditions are met to reveal information.

3. **SEARCH/SUMMON** -- players may *SEARCH* hallways or *SUMMON* in classrooms. This will reveal an ordinary item in hallways, and will reveal an item only if a room has been scryed in for classrooms (based on that room's aura). 
   - *summoning* in classrooms can be done while teachers are present, but it requires a *suspicion roll*
   - *searching* can be done while teachers are present, but it requires a *detention roll*
   - *summoning* additionally requires a *summoning roll*: if a 6 is rolled, the monster from the Other Realm will appear ***in the room***!

4. **DISTRACT!** -- players may project a distraction using their magic to a different tile, or cause an ordinary distraction on their current tile. this will use 1 ordinary
   item the player has, if they have any. this draws the attention of any teachers in a line of sight of the distraction: they will move closer to the distraction

5. **CAST** -- if a player is on a space which a monster could move to during its turn, they may cast towards the monster. If all players cast on their turns, the monster is defeated, and (this version) of the game is won!

6. **FLIP!** -- players may use the "*liminal*" aura room, once it is discovered on a floor, to "flip" to the Other Realm. This has the following effects:
   - teachers are completely ignored for *movement* and *distraction*, they can stil be *scryed*
   - the monster location is revealed on the floor, first time it is entered (perform the same dice roll as for teachers)
   - players may exit the Other Realm in any room, but if they exit in a room with a teacher, they have a chance to grow suspicious of the player, and the player must complete a *suspicion roll*. If the group fails 3 suspicion rolls collectively, the group will lose the game, as they are **IDENTIFIED** by the staff of the school.

On the *OTHER TURN*, the following movements happen:
1. Teachers move based on their assigned behaviors. If they have not been *scryed*, roll a d3 to determine how they move. Otherwise, the players can choose how they move.
2. Monsters move if they have been revealed, regardless of realm. Roll a d6 and move the monster based on their behavior. If a monster makes it to the *liminal room*, they
   flip to your realm.
   - if the monster enters a space with a teacher, the monster and the teacher are both *flipped* to the Other Realm. If 3 or more teachers are in the Other Realm at once, the game is lost.
   - you may recover a teacher by using *FLIP!* on a tile with them in the Other Realm. the first recovery will not arouse suspicion; subsequent ones will as normal

## ROLLS

- **Detention roll**: roll a D6. If 1, 2, or 3 is rolled, your character is immediately moved to the Detention classroom, and their turn is ended.
- **Summoning roll**: roll a D6. If a 6 is rolled, the monster will appear on the tile you summon on.
- **Suspicion roll**: roll a D6. If 4, 5, or 6 is rolled for a FLIP! back to the normal realm, or a 5 or 6 is rolled for a SUMMON, add 1 suspicion counter to your player. If your group has 3 or more suspicion counters, you lose the game.

## TEACHER BEHAVIORS

Easy teacher:

1. The teacher doesn't move.
2. The teacher moves 1 tile in a forward direction, along a predetermined path from the top-left to bottom-right tile (snaking) initially.
3. The teacher swaps the direction of their movement, to move along a path from the other top tile to the other bottom tile.

Hard teacher:

1. Move 1 tile towards the entryway or the stairwell (reverse direction if either is reached).
2. Move into an adjacent classroom, choosing with a dice roll each possible classroom equally.
3. Move into the hallway (from a classroom); move 2 tiles forward (in the hallway).

## MONSTER BEHAVIORS

First floor monster:

The monster will always lunge towards a player who is one tile adjacent, stunning them for 1 turn. Otherwise, roll for one of the following actions:

1. Move forward 2 tiles (similar to hard teacher)
2. Move to an adjacent classroom
3. FLIP! to the realm not currently in. Players may only interact with the monster (CAST) if they are all in the monster's dimension.
