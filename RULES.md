## Objective:

You are a group of best friends at **FOREST GROVE HIGH SCHOOL**. Unbeknownst to the rest of the school, you are a group of witches! 
Your powers are derived from a magical incident from when the (3/4) of you were younger. Now, the same forces that gave you your
magic then have found a new way to enter your world... through the walls of your high school! Your friend group serves as the last line
of defense between your dimension and the Other Realm. Unfortunately, you'll have to save everyone during a school day, and the negative
emotional aura exuding from the Other Realm has put all the teachers on edge. Can you put an end to the spirits invading your high school,
while also keeping the existence of the Other Realm secret?

## Items:
- d3
- 2 d6
- aura cards (one for each room)
- item cards (many per aura)
- teacher cards (one per teacher token, so like 6? 7? per session)
- spirit/monster cards (one per monster on the board, so 3 per session)

## CHARACTER SETUP:

Players are assigned a witch character, who has a special power. Read the trait which your character has, and perform any pre-game actions which that
trait may describe.

Place 3 teachers on the first floor, 4 teachers on the second floor, and 1 teacher, as well as the principal, on the final floor. Roll 2 six-sided die for the
first two floors to determine teacher placement. Roll 1 six-sided die to determine placement on the final floor. The principal always begins in the office.

All players begin in the **ENTRYWAY**. If any of the starting witches are **MISCHEVIOUS**, they may choose to start in the detention room instead.

Each player may draw an item (** from a specific pile?) to begin with.

## END STATES:
The players lose the game if any of the following happen:

1. Any member of the group is **IDENTIFIED** by enough teachers.
2. All members of the group are **EXHAUSTED** by a spirit (** maybe? basically combat loss)
3. Too many teachers are **TAKEN** to the Other Realm at once.
4. The spirits grow **RESTLESS**; the school becomes invaded. (** maybe?)

## GAMEPLAY:
Turns alternate between the **WITCH TURN** (players can move) and the **OTHER TURN** (teachers and monsters move). On the *WITCH TURN*, 
players can perform any number of the following actions once:

1. **MOVE** -- players can move up to the amount of tiles designated by their *SPEED*. 
    - players can move into a tile with a teacher, but not out of a tile with a teacher unless they want to roll for detention
    - players can advance up and down stairwells at no cost
    - only ending your move on a tile will trigger the effects of that tile, at the time you finish moving.

2. **SCRY** -- players may SCRY once per turn. Scrying reveals information about different things in the school.
    1. *scrying* on a tile will reveal that tile's *aura*. This hints at what item might appear when you *summon* on the tile. *scrying* in hallways will give you an ordinary item.
    2. Players may *scry* adjacent to a teacher to "reveal" that teacher's *mood*. Choose one action this teacher takes when they move, rather than rolling a dice. This wears off
    after leaving the floor.
    3. Players may *scry* monsters if they have a non-diagonal path to a monster. This hints at what can be used to defeat the monster.
    4. *scrying* can stack; multiple things in the game can be effected by scrying at once if the preconditions are met to reveal information.

3. **SEARCH/SUMMON** -- players may *SEARCH* hallways or *SUMMON* in classrooms. This will reveal an ordinary item in hallways, and will reveal an item only if a room has been scryed in for classrooms (based on that room's aura). 
   - *summoning* in classrooms cannot be done when a teacher is in the classrooms
   - *searching* can be done while teachers are present, but it requires a detention roll
   - *summoning* requires a roll: if a 6 is rolled, the monster from the Other Realm will appear ***in the room***!

4. **DISTRACT!** -- players may project a distraction using their magic to a different tile, or cause an ordinary distraction on their current tile. this will use 1 ordinary
   item the player has, if they have any. this draws the attention of any teachers in a line of sight of the distraction: they will move closer to the distraction

<!-- 5. **COMBAT** -- players may fight a monster. somehow. and hopefully win (with aura item). they can become **EXHAUSTED**, at which point the game ends. -->

6. **FLIP!** -- players may use the "*liminal*" aura room, once it is discovered on a floor, to "flip" to the Other Realm. This has the following effects:
   - teachers are completely ignored for *movement* and *distraction*, they can stil be *scryed*
   - the monster location is revealed on the floor, first time it is entered (perform the same dice roll as for teachers)
   - players may exit the Other Realm in any room, but if they exit in a room with a teacher, they have a 50-50 chance to be **SUS** of the player. If a teacher is too *SUS*, or enough teachers are *SUS*, the group will lose the game, as they are **IDENTIFIED** by the staff of the school.

On the *OTHER TURN*, the following movements happen:
1. Teachers move based on their assigned behaviors. If they have not been *scryed*, roll a d3 to determine how they move. Otherwise, the players can choose how they move.
2. Monsters move if they have been revealed, regardless of realm. Roll a d6 and move the monster based on their behavior. If a monster makes it to the *liminal room*, they
   flip to your realm.
   - if the monster enters a space with a teacher, the monster and the teacher are both *flipped* to the Other Realm. If 3 or more teachers are in the Other Realm at once, the game is lost.
   - you may recover a teacher by using *FLIP!* on a tile with them in the Other Realm. the first recovery will not arouse suspicion; subsequent ones will as normal

meta objective:
- identify items which can be used to defeat the monster
- reveal the monster
- fight the monster
- unlock the boss and beat them too
- boom you win

need to consider:
- not being revealed by teacher (map influences this a lot)
- protecting teachers (scrying monster maybe? to control behavior?)

stuff to have for session:
items -- how will they enhance gameplay? what incentivizes searching? is searching 1 and done for a tile, or per tile per player?
auras -- what are some fun things we can do?

teacher behaviors:
easy (repetition)

1. - dont rotate
2. - 1 tile in forward direction, snaking around hallway
3. - reverse direction

harder (more localized)

1. - 1 tile in forward direction
2. - pick adjacent room (in hallway, classroom, in classroom, another room, 50-50)
3. - move into the hallway

monster behaviors
if player in line of sight, lunge forward to player (stuns player for 1 turn)
if lands on player tile, stuns player for 1 turn
if lands on teacher tile, brings teacher into other realm
defeated by being surrounded by players on 3/4 sides, using items (for now...)

1. move forward 2 tiles (towards entrance)
2. move to an adjacent (diagonal too) classroom
3. flip to the realm not currently in
