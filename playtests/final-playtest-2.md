# Behaviors

## Teachers

### Easy
1. Doesn't move
2. Continue on current path
3. Change direction and move 1 step on that path

### Hard
1. 1 tile towards the entryway or reverse
2. Pick 2 adjacent classrooms, move into 1
3. Classroom- move into hallway, hallway- move towards nearest player in hallway or revert to 1.

notes:
trade items?
monster 1/6 if liminal is revealed after both turns
shoes = 2x use
scrying stacks but have to be on same space

classrooms seem useless w/o items
is snaking hard to track?

rarer item: instant flip, pen 

## Notes 

what worked:

- actions more well-defined, decision making felt more meaningful
- assessing eg. whether getting an item was worthwhile
- threat of monster looming after liminal space was revealed early added weight to each decision made

what needed work or didn't work

- monster mechanics still needed to be fleshed out: unclear how to "capture" based on current moveset
- no tradeoff to putting all items on one character: how to make more team play oriented?

what was enjoyable:

- puzzle solving aspect of managing teachers/monsters
- tension of rearranging teachers to prepare for the monster

what was unenjoyable:

- opening phase didn't last very long, so tension made all parts of the game interesting, but gameplay loop with teachers felt somewhat tedious
