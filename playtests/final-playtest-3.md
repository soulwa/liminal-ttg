## Notes

what worked:

- items given more meaningful weight, harder to find more powerful ones
- monster actually made sense! and defeatable, although more difficult (needed to use items), unless more risks with teachers were taken
- giving each witch an attribute made item allocation more meaningful

what didn't work:

- between playtests 2 and 3, scrying felt somewhat powerful with teachers: possibly have it eliminate an option, rather than determine? (that way 2 players could determine)
- bathroom, closet, special room simply empty, which made exploration less encouraged (plan to add things here- maybe a set item for each location? or fixed item pool ie. isaac)
- monster somewhat rng heavy in terms of movement: scrying could balance? but scrying requires being on space, so tradeoff here
    - make possible through scrying

what was enjoyable:

- solving the monster fight
- getting more powerful stuff felt more rewarding
- using witch powers in clever ways

what was not enjoyable:

- items sometimes too powerful within a single floor of the game: more distributed item pool might balance this out
- some witch powers felt possibly too powerful: need to balance to make the puzzle more challenging, rather than just a single road to victory
